# Apollo - ActionScript Entity Framework

## What it is

Apollo is an entity/component framework for ActionScript. Instead of building
your game objects with heirarchies, Apollo lets you build them with
components.

## What it isn't

It's not a replacement for things like Flixel or Flashpunk. They take care of
the stuff people see, Apollo does the "behind the scenes".

## Thanks

Apollo is inspired by Artemis, an entity framework for Java.
